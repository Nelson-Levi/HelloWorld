## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, andor add to this project in the future

 [ ] I could make the program display Hello World in different languages!

 [ ] I could experiment with a user menu. The user could select between phrases like Hello World, Good Morning World, and Greetings World.

 [ ] I could try elements of randomness. Maybe the program could randomly select a phrase instead of one hardcoded option.
